0.2.0 - Stable MySQL Querying
=============================

* **MySQL** connections have been more thoroughly tested, and project
  setup/syntax is considered generally stable.

    * **PostgreSQL** connections have been started, but are incomplete.

* Added basic output coloring and output show/hide args.
* Query validation logic could still use work, but is partially implemented.
* Has been tested in a live project and seems to have desired functionality,
  so long as queries are fairly basic (only basic SHOW/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE).
  These queries have been implemented for each of Database/Table/Record level.


0.1.0 - Initial Release
=======================

* First release.
* Very much WIP and subject to change.
* Minimal functionality.
* Not recommended for import/use in a live production project.

# Pythonic Database Connector
(py-dbcn)


## Description
THIS PACKAGE IS OUT OF DATE.

The goal was to make "database connections easier, and more consistent, across multiple database types".
It's semi-implemented, at least for MySQL and PostgreSQL.


But it's buggy and definitely needs work, and I just haven't had time.


In particular, the query syntax parsing really should be converted to a grammar, instead of Pythonic.
It should have been a grammar from the start, to be honest.


Maybe one day I'll get to this again and work on it further.
For now, it's in a half-implemented state. Use at your own risk.
